Good morning, everyone. Today, we are going to talk about the importance of setting goals and how to achieve them. Setting goals is a crucial part of personal development. It gives us direction, helps us stay focused, and motivates us to keep moving forward, even when things get tough.

Let me begin by telling you a short story. There was once a boy who dreamed of becoming a pilot. Every day, he would read books about airplanes, watch videos about flying, and even make paper planes to fly around the house. His dream seemed far away, but he believed in himself. He set small goals — learning English well, improving his math, and keeping his body strong. Years later, he really became a pilot. His dream came true not by chance, but by effort and planning.

So, what can we learn from this? First, we must have a clear goal. What do you want to achieve in the next year? Or in the next five years? Think about it. Do you want to improve your English? Get better at sports? Win a competition? Whatever it is, make it clear and specific. “I want to speak English better” is too vague. A better goal would be, “I want to pass the English speaking test next semester with a score above 85.”

Second, break your big goal into small steps. If you want to pass that test, you might set weekly goals like learning 10 new words, listening to one English podcast, or practicing speaking with a friend. When you finish a small step, give yourself some praise. These small wins will build your confidence.

Third, don’t be afraid of failure. Everyone makes mistakes. Even the best athletes and scientists fail many times. The key is not to give up. Learn from your mistakes and keep going. If you get a low score on a test, don’t be discouraged. Ask your teacher for advice, study a bit harder, and try again. Every step you take brings you closer to your goal.

Also, remember to ask for help. Your teachers, parents, and friends are all here to support you. Don’t feel shy to tell someone about your goals. Sometimes, sharing your goals with others can make you more determined to reach them.

Let’s also talk about time. Time is like water in your hands — if you don’t hold it carefully, it slips away. So, use your time wisely. Don’t wait until the last minute to start preparing. Make a study plan, write it down, and stick to it. A little progress every day will lead to big success over time.

And finally, be proud of yourself. Every step you take, no matter how small, is part of your journey. Believe in your ability to grow and improve. You are stronger than you think.

So, let’s all set a goal today. Think about something you really want to achieve. Write it down. Make a plan. Take the first step. And keep going. One day, you will look back and be proud of how far you’ve come.

That’s all for today. Thank you for listening.
